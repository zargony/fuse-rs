//!
//! A session runs a filesystem implementation while it is being mounted
//! to a specific mount point. A session begins by mounting the filesystem
//! and ends by unmounting it. While the filesystem is mounted, the session
//! loop receives, dispatches and replies to kernel requests for filesystem
//! operations under its mount point.
