//! FUSE userspace library implementation (as of libosxfuse-2.5.5).
//!
//! This is an improved rewrite of the FUSE userspace library (lowlevel
//! interface) to fully take advantage of Rust's architecture. The only thing
//! we rely on in the real libfuse are mount and unmount calls which are
//! needed to establish a fd to talk to the kernel driver.
